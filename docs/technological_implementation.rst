Descriptions of Each Method
---------------------------

1. Browser Extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Description: A browser extension that injects a tracking script into every webpage the user visits.

Perks:
    Works across different websites.
    Easy to distribute via browser extension stores.
Inconvenients:
    Limited to desktop browsers (no mobile support).
    Users must install the extension.

Ease of Implementation: 3/5

Use Case: Research, analytics, or user behavior studies on desktop browsers.

2. Proxy-Based Tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Description: A proxy server intercepts and modifies web traffic to inject a tracking script.

Perks:
    Works on all devices (desktop and mobile).
    Provides full control over traffic.
Inconvenients:
    Complex to set up and maintain.
    HTTPS traffic is encrypted, limiting visibility.

Ease of Implementation: 4/5

Use Case: Network-level research or monitoring.

3. VPN-Based Tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description: A VPN routes user traffic through a server where tracking scripts can be injected.

Perks:
    Encrypted tracking for privacy.
    Works on all devices.
Inconvenients:
    Requires users to install and configure the VPN.
    Complex to implement securely.

Ease of Implementation: 4/5

Use Case: Privacy-focused research or studies requiring encrypted traffic.

4. Browser Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description: Develop a custom browser (e.g., using Electron for desktop or WebView for mobile) with built-in tracking capabilities.

Perks:
    Full control over user behavior within the browser.
    Can be customized for specific research needs.

Inconvenients:
    Requires significant development effort.
    Users must download and use the custom browser.

Ease of Implementation: 2/5

Use Case: Custom browser-based research or studies requiring full control over the browsing environment.

5. JavaScript Injection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description: A JavaScript tracking script is injected into webpages to monitor user behavior.

Perks:
    Lightweight and easy to implement.
    Can track specific interactions (clicks, scrolls, etc.).
Inconvenients:
    Requires a method to inject the script (e.g., proxy or extension).
    Limited by HTTPS encryption.

Ease of Implementation: 3/5

Use Case: Web-specific research or analytics.
