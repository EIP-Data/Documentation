Pre Analysis
============

Context
-------

- On average, each user visits 137 pages per day on the Internet. This figure reflects the daily online activity of users, providing a key indicator of user engagement.
- Major tech companies, such as those in the GAFAM group (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft) and FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google), have a strong interest in tracking user behavior. Their business model heavily relies on harvesting user data, collected through their services, browsing activities, or interactions across various platforms. These data are then used for targeted advertising, recommendations, and in some cases, resold to other companies, generating significant profits.

Analysis Objectives
-------------------

The primary goal of this analysis is to gain a deep understanding of how major tech companies use user data to maximize their profits. Specifically, we aim to:

- Scrape behavioral data from a sample set of users to analyze how companies like Google, Facebook, etc., collect and utilize this data.
- Identify what is truly important for companies (e.g., preferences, browsing habits) and what isn't (e.g., irrelevant information, random behavior).
- Examine the implications of personal data exploitation, such as privacy management, information manipulation, and user consent consequences.
- Understand how these companies analyze the data to optimize their business models, whether through targeted ads, recommended products, or even the direct sale of collected information.

Methodology
------------

To achieve these objectives, we will set up a series of tools and processes to collect, analyze, and interpret user behavioral data. Specifically, we will:

1. **Develop scraping tools**: A browser extension will be used to collect browsing data from various user profiles. We will ensure compliance with privacy regulations and avoid violating any websites' terms of service.

2. **Analyze the collected data**: Once the data is gathered, we will conduct an in-depth analysis to extract relevant information. This will include examining the pages visited, session duration, preferred content types, and interaction frequency with ads or recommendations.

3. **Identify key patterns and behaviors**: We will aim to determine which aspects of user behavior are most leveraged by companies to create detailed user profiles. We will also highlight the less obvious but equally important data points that are collected.

4. **Interpret the results**: Based on this analysis, we will seek to understand the underlying mechanisms that allow companies to maximize their revenue through data collection and identify the ethical gray areas associated with this practice.

In summary, this analysis aims to explore how user data is turned into economic advantage for major tech companies while shedding light on the ethical, privacy, and economic implications of large-scale data collection.
