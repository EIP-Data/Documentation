Ideation & Thinking
-------------------

**Ideation**
This stage is dedicated to brainstorming and shaping the project's core idea. The team defines objectives and evaluates feasibility, setting the groundwork for development.

**Architectural Reflection**
Once the idea is refined, focus shifts to system architecture. The goal is to choose a robust structure that supports scalability and efficiency.

Development
-----------

**Web Extension Creation**
A lightweight browser extension is developed, designed to provide quick and intuitive access to essential features.

**Architecture Creation**
During this period, engineers design the systemâ€™s backbone, ensuring seamless communication between services.

**API Creation**
The backend is brought to life with efficient and secure APIs, ensuring data flows smoothly.

**Website Creation**
A user-friendly interface is built to allow seamless interaction with the platform.

Data Analysis & Iteration
-------------------------

**Website Iteration**
Improving charts and visual representation of data to enhance user experience and engagement.

**Data Analysis & Research**
Collected data is analyzed in-depth, forming the basis of a research paper that documents key insights.
